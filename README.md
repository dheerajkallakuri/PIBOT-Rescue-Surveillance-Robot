## Overview

PiBot is a cost-effective prototype designed for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations in urban disaster scenarios such as fire hazards, gas explosions, and building collapses. PiBot can operate in hazardous conditions, providing real-time data and live streaming to assist rescue teams in locating and assessing victims and dangers. It leverages minimal technology to keep costs low while ensuring effective communication and control.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Transmission:** Provides sensor readings for harmful gases, temperature, and obstacle detection.
- **Live Streaming:** Camera feed with pan-tilt mechanism for comprehensive site analysis.
- **Remote Operation:** Can be controlled over the same network or remotely via Team Viewer and DNS server.
- **Interactive GUI:** Web-based interface for controlling the bot and viewing data streams.

## Specifications

- **Processor:** Raspberry Pi
- **Camera:** Mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism
- **Sensors:** Gas sensors, temperature sensors, obstacle detection sensors
- **Motors:** Controlled via motor drivers
- **Communication:** Operates on the same network using IP address or remotely using Team Viewer

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components

- **Raspberry Pi:** Central processing unit for the bot.
- **Camera:** Provides live streaming with a pan-tilt mechanism.
- **Sensors:** Measure harmful gases, temperature, and obstacle distance.
- **Motors and Motor Drivers:** Control the movement of the bot.
- **Power Supply:** Batteries to power the bot.

### Software Components

- **Operating System:** Raspbian (Linux-based OS for Raspberry Pi)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Embedded C, JavaScript
- **Web Server:** Lighttpd for hosting the interactive GUI
- **Control Libraries:** WiringPi for GPIO control
- **Communication Protocols:** NODE.js for sensor data server

### Input and Output

- **Input:** Commands from the interactive GUI or keyboard inputs.
- **Output:** Sensor readings, live camera feed, motor control signals.

## Modes of Operation

1. **Same Network Mode:**
   - The controller and bot are on the same network.
   - Access the bot via the IP address using a web browser.
   
2. **Remote Network Mode:**
   - The controller operates the bot from a different network.
   - Utilizes Team Viewer and DNS server for remote access.
